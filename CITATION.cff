  Structures based on Triply periodic minimal surfaces
  (TPMS) are employed in catalysis, energy storage, and
  tissue engineering for biomedical applications, among
  others. They excel in mechanical performance, surface
  area, and transport properties compared to traditional
  lattice structures. This work introduces a versatile tool
  designed to facilitate the creation and manipulation of
  TPMS-based structures. It provides total control over
  lattice properties, for 3D printing and Finite Element
  simulation purposes. By operating within a Python
  environment, ensuring accessibility and compatibility with
  both online and offline workflows, LisbonTPMS-tool aims to
  become a valuable resource to employ TPMS-based structures
  in practical applications.
